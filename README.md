# CARA-IP
Let your imagination see different faces of an image.

In the world of AI, we want to make sure artist feel empowered to be their creative selfs. Cara is ment as a playground, where you can upload your photographs or any image, and with words edit it in any way you want.  At the same time, each piece or art is being tracker by Mentaport off chain and is being registered as an IP to Story protocol. This combination is very powerful because if you find an image in the web2 land,   now you can edit it with Cara and automatically Cara will detect the owner and allow you to create a  new IP but with the incredible add-on of derivatives from Story.
